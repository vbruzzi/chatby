# CHATBY
Chatby is a chat room app I made to learn more about web sockets. It is made with Python, Angular, MongoDB and Socket.IO. You can find a live demo [here](http://chatby-api.herokuapp.com/) (it may take a while for Heroku to boot the project).

## Setup
To set up, you should run `npm install` to install any packages needed. After that, you can run `ng serve -o` and the website will open. By default, it is connected to my Socket.IO server and API, so it will work, but if you wish to run locally you still have to run the API and the socket simultaneously. You can find the API [here](https://github.com/vbruzzi/quizzy-api) and the socket [here](https://github.com/vbruzzi/chatby-socket).
